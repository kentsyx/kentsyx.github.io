I am a graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering). My research interest lies in machine vision and machine learning. In the past I have been developing new methods to better predict scene depth and camera motion in visual SLAM systems. I am currently working as machine learning intern at [Blue River Technology](http://www.bluerivertechnology.com/).

Before coming to New York I did my bachelor and master in mathematics at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) where I conducted research on nonconvex penalty for sparse regression problems. I am also interested in the application of statistics and machine learning in the financial industry.
